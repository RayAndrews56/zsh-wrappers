# zsh-wrappers
my favorite zsh wrappers around common commands: grep, find, cd, etc.
This is my first use of github, a real README will follow once I get this thing up and running.

For now, very briefly: 

I've never uploaded or attempted to share any of my zsh coding.  I don't know what the protocols are, and my code is no doubt amaturish.  If anyone shows any interest in the functions here, I hope for reviews and improvments from competent zsh users!  The 'zshrc' and 'zstyle' files are my zsh bootup files, they are included just in case anything there is needed.  At the very least the 'preexec()' and 'precmd()' and 'chpwd()' functions in 'zshrc' are needed for my 'c()' function to work. 'zstyle' is there just in case any of the options shown are needed.
